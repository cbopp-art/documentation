# Development

## Environments

The website Service is aware of those Environments:

 * DEV
 * STAGE
 * PROD

See the [Service Documentation](/services/website.md#Environments) for Details.


## Vagrant

We rely on Vagrant to create local VMs for your purposes. You can use those Vagrant boxes to develop your favorite application in there, but also to make changes at our Puppet environment itself. See [Vagrant](development/vagrant.md) for all details.
