# Development

## Environments

The website Service is aware of those Environments:

 * DEV
 * STAGE
 * PROD

See the [Service Documentation](/services/websites/index.md#server/dualstack/index.md#Environments) for Details.


## Vagrant

All Services where developed on Vagrant only. Therefore, you can expect a smooth experience using Vagrant to develop your websites.

Hint: By now, we used Vagrant within our Puppet modules repository only. We will figure out the best way to integrate our Vagrant environment within other projects soon.
