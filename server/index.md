# Server

## Create/Modify

By now, there are still some manual steps required to install a new server.
Therefore, you have to order them manually through our [team](../support/).
We are working hard to finish our API where those manual steps are not required
anymore.

In the meantime, we will receive orders for new servers trough
[mail](mailto:support@snowflake.ch?subject=Order Server). Please submit the
following informations:

- billing contact
- technical contact, if applicable
- desired hostname
- size (CPU, Memory, Diskspace)
